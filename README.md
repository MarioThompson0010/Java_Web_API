# Java_Web_API
November 2020

This back-end web API runs a Wildfly server.  This is how the web API runs.  When the user goes to Postman, and simulates a front-end web call, the user receives a result in JSON.  Almost no HTML was written.

This is a non-enterprise level banking web-API, written in Java.  The following functions are implemented: transfer funds, login, logout, deposit, withdraw, find account given user, find user given account, find accounts by status, create a link between user and account, create user, etc.

Technologies used: Java, SQL, PostresQL, Eclipse
